excerpt: "Nigeria’s dairy sector isn’t broken because we lack cows. It’s broken because everything around the cow,the feed, the breed, the pasture, the data, the cold chain have been neglected. Here’s why productivity, not herd size, should define the future of Nigerian dairy."

We often talk about fixing Nigeria’s dairy sector as if it begins and ends with cows. But here’s the uncomfortable truth: **cows are not the real problem.**

I once wondered why fresh milk is everywhere in Kenya, yet feels like a luxury in Nigeria. That curiosity led me to dairy farming, and what I found was far more complex than I imagined. Nigeria’s dairy challenge isn’t about a shortage of animals. It’s about the **ecosystem around them**—the systems, the feed, the land, the data, and the market. And almost every piece of that ecosystem is fragile.

On the surface, dairy farming looks simple. You get cows, you get milk. But step inside, and the reality is sobering. The breed you own dictates your fate; most Nigerian cattle are optimised for beef, not milk. Expecting high yields from them is like expecting a motorcycle to haul a truckload. Even if you secure land, pasture becomes a daily gamble. Preparing it is costly, improved seeds are expensive, and mechanisation is scarce. And when milk finally flows, it’s a race against time. Without reliable power, chilling is impossible, so milk spoils before it reaches the market.

The market itself offers little relief. Consumers remain largely uneducated on the nutritional value of fresh milk, leaving demand weak and fragmented. Farmers operate without meaningful data, logistics crumble easily, and insecurity adds a final layer of risk.

When solutions exist, they are so prohibitively expensive that the average farmer can’t reach them. Yet we continue to cling to myths. *“Dairy farming? It doesn’t cost much to set up.”* Nothing could be further from the truth. Cows alone won’t save this sector. What matters is the **invisible infrastructure** around them: the pasture, the feed systems, the cold chain, the veterinary support, the market linkages. Without these, a cow is not an asset. It’s a liability.

If there is one silent killer of Nigeria’s dairy potential, it’s this: **inferior breeds and poor-quality feed.** No amount of effort can turn a low-yielding cow into a high-performing one. And even the best breeds will fail if they’re fed on overgrazed, nutrient-poor land. Until we fix this foundation, everything else is just patchwork.

But here’s the thing—**it doesn’t have to stay this way.** I envision a Nigeria where fewer cows produce more milk because productivity, not herd size, drives the industry. Where milk no longer spoils before it reaches processors because power supply is stable and cold chain infrastructure is reliable. Where feed is abundant and affordable, eliminating the gamble of poor pasture. Where data drives decisions, giving farmers, processors, and policymakers a clear view of the value chain. Where barriers to entry are lower, allowing smallholders and commercial farmers alike to see real returns on their investment.

This isn’t just about milk. It’s about **nation-building**—reducing imports, strengthening rural economies, and creating a profitable, sustainable dairy sector driven by homegrown solutions.

If I sat with a policymaker today, my message would be simple: **start investing in breeding programs that truly optimise for milk. Fix the feed problem.** Without quality breeds and feed, we’re not transforming dairy; we’re just pouring money into a bucket with holes.

Nigeria’s dairy sector needs **better systems.** Get breed, feed, infrastructure, and education right, and we won’t just produce more milk. **We’ll produce hope.** Because dairy, done right, is more than an industry. It’s a lifeline for farmers, for families, and for a country that should no longer rely on imported milk.
